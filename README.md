okay so there is an explosion of a slightly randomised force, somewhere between half and three-quarters of the way
through projectile motion

the bomb is assumed to be a circle. and the fragments clean cut sectors of the circle. then, their centre of mass is along the
radius that starts from the middle of the sector of each fragment (by symmetry).

the masses are randomised to be equal to the sum M

the speed of each is given by conservation of momentum (x and y components seperately):

speed = (impulse + (initial_speed*fragment_mass)) / fragment_mass

the current results show that the centre of mass is always close or approximately equal to the original trajectory (even for
large forces) but not necessarily exactly the same.
BTW, these results also hold if we move the explosion to before the appex


if you can't see because of the labels, comment out the last "legend" line
