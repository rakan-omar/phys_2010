okay so there is an explosion of a slightly randomised force, somewhere between half and three-quarters of the way
through projectile motion

the bomb is assumed to be a circle. and the fragments clean cut sectors of the circle. then, their centre of mass is along the
radius that starts from the middle of the sector of each fragment (by symmetry).

the masses are randomised to be equal to the sum M

the speed of each is  given by conservation of momentum (x and y components seperately):

speed = (impulse + (initial_speed*fragment_mass)) / fragment_mass
